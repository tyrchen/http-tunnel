# HTTP Tunnel Improvement Specification

**Document Version**: 1.0
**Date**: 2024-01-26
**Status**: Draft

## Executive Summary

This document outlines recommended improvements for the http-tunnel serverless tunneling service. After comprehensive analysis of the codebase, architecture, dependencies, and operational patterns, we've identified opportunities for enhancement across code quality, performance, security, observability, developer experience, and infrastructure.

The improvements are categorized by priority (High, Medium, Low) and impact area. Implementation would incrementally enhance the system without requiring a complete rewrite, maintaining backward compatibility where possible.

---

## 1. Code Quality & Architecture Improvements

### 1.1 Error Handling Consistency

**Priority**: High
**Impact**: Reliability, Debugging

**Current State**:
- Mix of `anyhow::Result` and `TunnelError` types across codebase
- Inconsistent error context in some handlers
- Some errors swallowed with `error!()` logs without propagation

**Issues**:
- Hard to trace error origins in production
- Lambda CloudWatch logs don't always include full error context
- Error responses to clients could be more informative

**Recommended Changes**:
1. Standardize on custom error types with `thiserror` throughout
2. Implement error context chain with `anyhow::Context` at every boundary
3. Add structured error codes for API responses
4. Create error middleware for consistent Lambda response formatting

**Benefits**:
- Better observability and debugging
- Consistent error responses for clients
- Easier to trace error flows through distributed system

---

### 1.2 Request/Response Correlation & Tracing

**Priority**: High
**Impact**: Observability, Debugging

**Current State**:
- Request IDs generated but not consistently propagated
- No distributed tracing across Lambda invocations
- Limited correlation between WebSocket messages and HTTP requests

**Recommended Changes**:
1. Add `correlation_id` to all log statements using `tracing::Span`
2. Propagate request IDs through all DynamoDB operations
3. Add X-Ray tracing for Lambda functions (AWS SDK integration)
4. Include timing metrics at each processing stage
5. Add structured logging fields: `tunnel_id`, `connection_id`, `request_id`

**Implementation Example**:
```rust
#[instrument(skip(clients), fields(
    tunnel_id = %routing_mode.tunnel_id(),
    request_id = %request_id,
    method = %method
))]
async fn handle_forwarding(...) -> Result<...> {
    // All logs within this function will include these fields
}
```

**Benefits**:
- End-to-end request tracing
- Easier debugging of latency issues
- Better CloudWatch Insights queries

---

### 1.3 Configuration Management

**Priority**: Medium
**Impact**: Maintainability, Deployment

**Current State**:
- Environment variables scattered across code
- No centralized configuration struct
- Hardcoded defaults in multiple places
- Missing configuration validation on startup

**Issues**:
- Difficult to understand all configuration options
- Runtime errors from missing environment variables
- No validation until first use

**Recommended Changes**:
1. Create centralized `Config` struct for Lambda handler
2. Implement config validation on Lambda cold start
3. Add config documentation and examples
4. Use `config` or `figment` crate for hierarchical config (env vars, files, defaults)
5. Add configuration dump to logs on startup (redacting secrets)

**Example Structure**:
```rust
#[derive(Debug, Clone)]
pub struct LambdaConfig {
    pub connections_table: String,
    pub pending_requests_table: String,
    pub websocket_endpoint: String,
    pub base_domain: String,
    pub event_driven_enabled: bool,
    pub auth_enabled: bool,
    pub jwks_url: Option<String>,
    pub request_timeout_secs: u64,
    pub connection_ttl_hours: u32,
}

impl LambdaConfig {
    pub fn from_env() -> Result<Self> {
        // Validate all required env vars on load
        // Fail fast if misconfigured
    }
}
```

**Benefits**:
- Fail fast on misconfiguration
- Better documentation
- Easier testing with config injection

---

### 1.4 Code Duplication & Modularization

- No caching of connection metadata
- GSI queries without projection expressions

**Issues**:
- Wastes read capacity units
- Adds 50-200ms latency per poll
- Costs increase linearly with concurrent requests

**Recommended Changes**:
1. **Enable DynamoDB Streams + EventBridge (event-driven mode)**:
   - Already partially implemented but disabled by default
   - Eliminate most polling with pub/sub pattern
   - Estimated 70-90% reduction in DynamoDB reads

2. **Add in-memory caching for connection metadata**:
   - Lambda container reuse provides natural cache
   - Cache connection_id → tunnel_id mappings
   - 5-minute TTL with LRU eviction
   - Use `once_cell::sync::Lazy<Mutex<LruCache>>`

3. **Use DynamoDB projection expressions**:
   - Only fetch needed attributes from GSI queries
   - Reduce data transfer and parsing overhead

4. **Batch cleanup operations**:
   - Current cleanup scans entire table
   - Use parallel scan with batch writes
   - Add time-based partitioning for faster scans

**Expected Impact**:
- 40-60% reduction in DynamoDB costs
- 20-50ms latency improvement per request
- Better scaling characteristics

2. Batch multiple pending requests to same connection
3. Add client-side request queuing with configurable batch window

**Benefits**:
- Higher throughput for request-heavy workloads
- Reduced WebSocket overhead
- Better Lambda concurrency utilization

---

### 2.3 Lambda Cold Start Optimization

**Priority**: Medium
**Impact**: Latency (P99)

**Current State**:
- Cold starts: ~500-800ms for Rust Lambda
- Every dependency loaded synchronously
- No Lambda provisioned concurrency configured

**Recommended Changes**:
1. **Lazy initialization of AWS clients**:
   - Only initialize clients when needed
   - Use `once_cell` for thread-safe lazy statics

2. **Lambda SnapStart compatibility** (when Rust supported):
   - Structure code for SnapStart readiness
   - Minimize global state mutations

3. **Provisioned concurrency for production**:
   - Configure via Pulumi for critical paths
   - Keep 2-5 warm instances for HTTP forwarding handler

4. **Reduce binary size**:
   - Use `strip = true` in release profile
   - Audit unused dependencies
   - Consider splitting handler into multiple functions

**Expected Impact**:
- P99 latency: 800ms → 200ms
- Better user experience for infrequent tunnels
